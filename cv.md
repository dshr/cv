## Work

### Developer at TOAD London
##### November 2014 - Present

[TOAD](https://toadlondon.com) is a creative agency in the heart of Shoreditch, with a diverse portfolio of projects, ranging from app development to video production and everything in between. Working in such an environment means using a wide selection of tools, allowing me to work with both the trendiest **JavaScript and NodeJS** frameworks and plain old **WordPress**. During my time at TOAD I got into iOS development with **Swift**, creating and shipping two apps that are currently available on the App Store - [OnBeat](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/onbeat-the-art-of-clubbing/id1046460886), a clubbing event discovery app, and [Goalmouth](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/goalmouth-premier-league-predictions/id1093231381), a brand new football betting experience.

### Developer Intern at Overleaf (then WriteLaTeX)
##### July-September 2014

Overleaf is an online collaborative platform for scientific writing based on LaTeX. During my time there I worked across a full **Ruby-On-Rails** stack using **Ruby** and the latest **HTML5, CSS3 and JS** technologies at the time. I designed and implemented the [referral awards system](https://www.writelatex.com/space) from the ground up along with other front-end and back-end projects.

## Education

### Queen Mary University Of London
#### 2:1 BEng (Hons) Audio Systems Engineering
##### 2012 - 2015

This programme was a link between digital technologies and music, pretty much two of my biggest passions, which is why I chose it. It provided me with a strong programming foundation, with an emphasis on both **group work** and **independent study and research**, along with a firm grasp of **real-time Digital Signals Processing**.

For my final project I designed and implemented a tiny Virtual Analogue synthesiser. Using Vesa Välimäki's PolyBLEP algorithm, Antti Huovilainen's Moog Low-Pass filter model and lots of polynomial approximations, I successfully managed to run it on an ARM Cortex M4-based STM32F4Discovery board and get it to receive MIDI control signals. You can check out the source code on [github.com/dshr/tinySynth](https://github.com/dshr/tinySynth).

### Saint-Petersburg State University Of Cinema and Television
#### Audiovisual Technology
##### 2008 - 2012

This was a thorough course into the technology behind moving image and sound. With a strong shift towards analogue cinema, this degree gave me a solid foundation in **engineering mathematics, physics and analogue electronics.**

## Other

Music is a big part of my life. I used to play guitar in a band back in Saint-Petersburg and dabbled in music production, going as far as mixing and mastering one of my band's EPs. Right now I mainly record at home into Ableton Live and play around in Pure Data.

I also enjoy going to the odd hackathon or doing a game development challenge.
