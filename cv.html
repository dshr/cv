<h5 id="november-2014---present">November 2014 - Present</h5>
<p><a href="https://toadlondon.com">TOAD</a> is a creative agency in the heart of Shoreditch, with a diverse portfolio of projects, ranging from app development to video production and everything in between. Working in such an environment means using a wide selection of tools, allowing me to work with both the trendiest <strong>JavaScript and NodeJS</strong> frameworks and plain old <strong>WordPress</strong>. During my time at TOAD I got into iOS development with <strong>Swift</strong>, creating and shipping two apps that are currently available on the App Store - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/onbeat-the-art-of-clubbing/id1046460886">OnBeat</a>, a clubbing event discovery app, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/goalmouth-premier-league-predictions/id1093231381">Goalmouth</a>, a brand new football betting experience.</p>

<h5 id="july-september-2014">July-September 2014</h5>
<p>Overleaf is an online collaborative platform for scientific writing based on LaTeX. During my time there I worked across a full <strong>Ruby-On-Rails</strong> stack using <strong>Ruby</strong> and the latest <strong>HTML5, CSS3 and JS</strong> technologies at the time. I designed and implemented the <a href="https://www.writelatex.com/space">referral awards system</a> from the ground up along with other front-end and back-end projects.</p>

<h4 id="beng-hons-audio-systems-engineering">2:1 BEng (Hons) Audio Systems Engineering</h4>
<h5 id="section">2012 - 2015</h5>
<p>This programme was a link between digital technologies and music, pretty much two of my biggest passions, which is why I chose it. It provided me with a strong programming foundation, with an emphasis on both <strong>group work</strong> and <strong>independent study and research</strong>, along with a firm grasp of <strong>real-time Digital Signals Processing</strong>.</p>
<p>For my final project I designed and implemented a tiny Virtual Analogue synthesiser. Using Vesa Välimäki's PolyBLEP algorithm, Antti Huovilainen's Moog Low-Pass filter model and lots of polynomial approximations, I successfully managed to run it on an ARM Cortex M4-based STM32F4Discovery board and get it to receive MIDI control signals. You can check out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/dshr/tinySynth">github.com/dshr/tinySynth</a>.</p>

<h5 id="section-1">2008 - 2012</h5>
<p>This was a thorough course into the technology behind moving image and sound. With a strong shift towards analogue cinema, this degree gave me a solid foundation in <strong>engineering mathematics, physics and analogue electronics.</strong></p>

<p>Music is a big part of my life. I currently play guitar in a band back and dabble in music production, mixing and mastering my bands tracks for my friends and myself. I also experiment with electronic music and sound design in MaxMSP and Pure Data.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I enjoy going to the odd hackathon or doing a game development challenge.</p>
